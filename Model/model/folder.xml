    purpose="This model represents the current and proposed state of the maintenance process for critical assets subject to uncertain demand. This kind of assets has the following characteristics:&#xD;&#xA;- Assets used to deliver a service that has a high penalty for unmet demand&#xD;&#xA;- They require a large amount of preventive maintenance&#xD;&#xA;After an analysis of the current situation, we identified 5 main challenges that need to be addressed in order to achieve the business objectives:&#xD;&#xA;1. Lack of Demand Data&#xD;&#xA;2. Absence of Automated Method to Update Annual Estimates&#xD;&#xA;3. Inability to Perform Weekly Forecasts&#xD;&#xA;4. Bad User Experience for Maintenance Shift Supervisor&#xD;&#xA;5. Absence of Single Point of Data Aggregation to Aid in Decision Making&#xD;&#xA;We modeled these challenges using ArchiMate, an open and independent modelling language for enterprise architecture that is supported by different tool vendors and consulting firms and organized the diagrams (&quot;views&quot;) in folders that can be accesed from the side menu. For every challenge, we present 5 views: a) Motivation view, which presents the business objectives that need to be achieved by the proposed state, b) Business As-Is View, refers to a graphical representation of the current situation for the business layer, c) Business To-Be View, is our proposed business layer for every challenge, d) Application As-Is View, presents the current application components and services that support (b) and, finally, e) Application To-Be View, presents the recommended improvements at the application layer to accomplish the desired state from (c)."
