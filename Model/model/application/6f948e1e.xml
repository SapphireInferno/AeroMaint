    documentation="Because maintenance resources – such as work stations, machines, or personnel – are limited, it is necessary to distribute the necessary, periodic maintenance tasks evenly over a year for all the aircraft within a maintenance cycle. The use of aircraft must be monitored to ensure that too many maintenance tasks are not due at the same time. This operation is known as controlled usage rate .&#xD;&#xA;In the Controlled Usage Rate application (transaction /ISDFPS/LMCUS1), you can display maintenance-relevant data in a table or graphical overview, and navigate to the detail views."/>
