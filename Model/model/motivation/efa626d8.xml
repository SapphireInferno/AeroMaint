As limited resources are available to support maintenance and external services (such as provision of spare parts) and usage of these resources is roughly proportional to the aggregate usage of the aircraft type, limits in terms of permitted aggregate annual usage for an Aircraft Type are established.  For individual aircraft, certain major and extensive maintenance activities are required proportional to the amount of usage the aircraft experiences. As resources (such as specialized hangar facilities, tooling, personnel, etc.) are constrained, limiting individual aircraft to a certain amount of usage for a given period is used to deconflict demand for the specialized resources required for major and extensive maintenance activities."/>
