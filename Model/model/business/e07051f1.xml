    documentation="Every business has limited facilities, which are constraints to assign the maintenance tasks. For instance, a task could require a specific environment, provided only by one of the facilities. If more than one aircraft requires this maintenance taks, then there will be a queue of aircraft waiting to use that facility. The objective of &quot;coordinate facility usage&quot; is to allocate the tasks in such a way that the queue length is minimized."/>
